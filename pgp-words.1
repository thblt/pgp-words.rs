.SH NAME
pgp-words \- generate dictation-friendly hexadecimal equivalents

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpgp-words\fR [hexadecimal string]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpgp-words\fR is an implementation of the \fIPGP Word List\fR. The
word list was designed to make it easy to convey sequences of bytes
using only voice, and is particularly suited for transmitting key
fingerprints and other similar sequences over the phone. Even in the
same physical place, it's easier to just read a bunch of words out
loud than to spell a sequence of hex digits (was that 3 times F or
3F?)

Each word represents exactly one byte. To avoid errors, there are
actually 512 words in the list (two per possible byte value) and words
are selected depending on the parity of the byte position. For
example, `0x9e` is `quiver` if the byte position in the sequence is an
even number, `onlooker` if it is odd.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-no-echo

.TP
\-\-passthrough

.TP
.B -w, \-\-words-per-line NUMBER
Number of words to output before emitting a line-break.  Default is 4.

.TP
.B -s, \-\-silent-errors
Silently ignore invalid inputs.  This is especially useful in
